ok so i got to problem 26 ...

am seriously thrashing about gettign nowhere ...
finding it hard to break out of patterns of recursion that result in
array patterns like '[1,[2,[3,[4]]]]'' or are derrivatives of.


So if anyone reading this has any advice suggestions or pointers.
Links that might help me jump the shark and figure out how to do this without simply giving me the answer that would be awesome.
